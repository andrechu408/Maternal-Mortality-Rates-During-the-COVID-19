Caveats:
"1. The population figures for years 2022 and later are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage"
"2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023. The 2022 series is based on the Modified Blended Base"
"produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Modified Blended Base consists of"
"the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates for April 1, 2020, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020"
"Census data from the internal Census Edited File (CEF). The population figures for years 2021 are single-race estimates of the"
"July 1 resident population, based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial"
"population count, from the Vintage 2021 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 30, 2022. The population figures"
"for year 2020 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2020 postcensal series based on"
"April 2010 Census, released by the Census Bureau on July 27, 2021. The population figures for year 2019 are single-race"

"3. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More"
"information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"4. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas, instead of the"
